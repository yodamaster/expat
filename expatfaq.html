<H1>Frequently Asked Questions about Expat</H1>

<H4>Where can I get the latest version of expat?</H4>

<p>The latest production version is always available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip"
>ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip</a>.  The latest test version
is always available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/test/expat.zip"
>ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/test/expat.zip</a>.</p>

<H4>Where can I get help in using expat?</H4>

<p>Try the xml-dev mailing list (subscribe by mailing to <a
href="mailto:majordomo@ic.ac.uk">majordomo@ic.ac.uk</a> with the
message <code>subscribe xml-dev</code>).  Alternatively try the <a
href="news:comp.text.xml">comp.text.xml</a> USENET newsgroup.</p>

<H4>Where is expat's API documented?</H4>

<p>In <code>xmlparse/xmlparse.h</code>.  There's also an advanced,
low-level API you can use which is documented in
<code>xmltok/xmltok.h</code>.</p>

<H4>Is there a simple example of using expat's API?</H4>

<p>See <code>sample/elements.c</code></p>

<H4>How can I get expat to deal with non-ASCII characters?</H4>

<P>By default, expat assumes that documents are encoded in UTF-8.  In
UTF-8, ASCII characters are represented by a single byte as they would
be in ASCII, but non-ASCII characters are represented by a sequence of
two or more bytes all with the 8th bit set.  The encoding most widely
used for European languages is ISO 8859-1 which is not compatible with
UTF-8.  To use this encoding, expat must be told either by supplying
an argument of <code>"iso-8859-1"</code> to
<code>XML_ParserCreate</code>, or by starting the document with
<code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;</code>.</P>

<H4>What encodings does expat support?</H4>

<P>expat has built in support for the following encodings:</P>

<ul>
<li><code>utf-8</code></li>
<li><code>utf-16</code></li>
<li><code>iso-8859-1</code></li>
<li><code>us-ascii</code></li>
</ul>

<P>Additional encodings can be supported by using
<code>XML_SetUnknownEncodingHandler</code>.</P>

<H4>How can I get expat to validate my XML documents?</H4>

<p>You can't.  expat is not a validating parser.</p>

<H4>How can I get expat to read my DTD?</H4>

<p>expat only reads the internal DTD subset.  It doesn't process an
external DTD nor parameter entity references.  This behaviour is in
conformance with the XML Recommendation.</p>

<H4>Why does expat give the wrong result for the more complex example in
Appendix D of the XML Recommendation?</H4>

<P>expat does not process parameter entity references.  (The XML
Recommendation only requires parsers to process parameter entity
references when validating. See section 4.4.8.)</P>

<H4>Why does expat give the wrong result for test cases in James
Clark's test suite in the <code>xmltest/valid/not-sa</code>?</H4>

<P>expat doesn't process parameter entities.</P>

<H4>How can I get expat to recover from errors?</H4>

<p>You can't.  All well-formedness errors stop processing.  Note that
the XML Recommendation does not permit conforming XML processors to
continue normal processing after a fatal error.</p>

<H4>How do I get at the characters between tags?</H4>

<p>Use <code>XML_SetCharacterDataHandler</code>.</p>
