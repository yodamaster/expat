Release 1.95.3 Mon Jun 3 2002
	- Added a project to the MSVC workspace to create a wchar_t
	  version of the library; the DLLs are named libexpatw.dll.

	  libexpat.dll; this fixes SF bug #432456.
	- Added the XML_ParserReset() API function.
	- Fixed XML_SetReturnNSTriplet() to work for element names.
	- Made the XML_UNICODE builds usable (thanks, Karl!).

	  547350.  Other bugs which we can't test as easily may also
	  have been fixed, especially in the area of build support.

Release 1.95.2 Fri Jul 27 2001
	- More changes to make MSVC happy with the build; add a single
	  workspace to support both the library and xmlwf application.
	- Added a Windows installer for Windows users; includes
	  xmlwf.exe.
	- Added compile-time constants that can be used to determine the
	  Expat version

	  among the various Unix flavors.
	- Fix the UTF-8 BOM bug.
	- Cleaned up warning messages for several compilers.
	- Added the -Wall, -Wstrict-prototypes options for GCC.

	- Changes to get expat to build under Microsoft compiler
	- Removed all aborts and instead return an UNEXPECTED_STATE error.
	- Fixed a bug where a stray '%' in an entity value would cause an
	  abort.
	- Defined XML_SetEndNamespaceDeclHandler. Thanks to Darryl Miles for
	  finding this oversight.
	- Changed default patterns in lib/Makefile.in to fit non-GNU makes
	  Thanks to robin@unrated.net for reporting and providing an
	  account to test on.

	- XML_ParserCreate_MM
		Allows you to set a memory management suite to replace the
		standard malloc,realloc, and free.
	- XML_SetReturnNSTriplet
		If you turn this feature on when namespace processing is in
		effect, then qualified, prefixed element and attribute names
		are returned as "uri|name|prefix" where '|' is whatever
		separator character is used in namespace processing.
	- Merged in features from perl-expat
		o XML_SetElementDeclHandler
		o XML_SetAttlistDeclHandler
		o XML_SetXmlDeclHandler
		o XML_SetEntityDeclHandler
		o StartDoctypeDeclHandler takes 3 additional parameters:
			sysid, pubid, has_internal_subset
		o Many paired handler setters (like XML_SetElementHandler)
		  now have corresponding individual handler setters
		o XML_GetInputContext for getting the input context of
		  the current parse position.
	- Added reference material
	- Packaged into a distribution that builds a sharable library
