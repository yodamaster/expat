Changes for Expat 1.95.3
Release date:  2002-Apr-XX
--------------------------

 * Added XML_ParserReset(), a new function which resets a parser
   without freeing memory pools.  When parsing many small documents,
   this can make a performance improvement due to the avoided malloc()
   calls.  Contributed by David Crowley as SF patch #450608.

 * Many changes to the build process to improve cross-platform
   support.

 * Fixed XML_SetReturnNSTriplet() to work for element names.

 * Fixed support for XML_UNICODE, allowing UTF-16 output to be
   usable.

 * Added several regression tests.

 * Added a Unix man page for xmlwf.

 * Allow xmlwf to read from standard input.
